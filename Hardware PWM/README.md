# Hardware PWM
# Software PWM
The objective of this lab is to press a button that will increase the brightness of an LED. This is done by incrementing the pwm of the LED. The higher the duty cycle the brighter the LED becomes. 

The difference in code between the two boards is that there are different pins for the LEDs and buttons. Also, for the FR6989 you must disable the GPIO power-on default high-impedance mode.
